# Write a Python program that prints if a given year was (or will) be a leap year.
# Tip: A leap year is "a year, occurring once every four years, that has 366 days
# including February 29 as an intercalary day." (Definition by Oxford Languages).
# This is how you can determine if a year is a leap year or not:
# if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year).
# else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
# else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
# else (it is a leap year)

year = 2020

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
